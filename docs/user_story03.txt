As a logged in user, I would like to register my summoner name and region, to make future use of the app more convienent.
To do so, I will navigate the profile tab of the app.
Once there, I will select the option to register a League of Legends account.
After entering my summoner name and region, that information will be linked to my TuneTerra account and stored in a database.
Once registered, I will be able to skip the entry part for summoner name and region while using the app.
