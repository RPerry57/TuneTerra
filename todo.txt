League of Legends Music

- Use riot and spotify API

	We will be building an app that will allow league of legends players to input their username, and get a spotify playlist based off of the character they are playing live. Prospective functionality includes auto-generated custom playlists based off of character key-words. Other functionality may include playlists based off of a player's recent performance or favorite characters. Playlists will be generated by sentiment analysis.

- Riot API
	- Use live client data API to get current game data
	- Use CDragon community api to get champion lore data
	- Use keyword extraction to extract keywords
	- Match keywords with suitable songs
		- Manually associate league terms with actual words

- Spotify API
	- Sentiment analysis to sort sutiable songs
		- If unfeasable/unable to implement, find playlists w/ champion name
	- pick random assortment from suitable songs for a on-the-spot generated playlist
	- Auth api to log into Spotify
